The last several months have been a hallowing and trying experience. I lost another toe this winter. Seven still remain, faithful friends as they are. This wilderness in which I've become accustom is unforgiving as my father; as cold as my mother.

I have been whittling a pinhole camera out of elk antlers, purposing to record my surroundings for those that come after me. Having forgone a dozen, dozen meals and resigning myself to a strict and exhausting diet of berries and insects, my work has finally been completed. My bones are weak and have begun to protrude from my body. My muscles are weak. My arms oft dangle, with no strength to lift them. Using trout skin as a film substitute I've managed to capture and record the raw wild in which I have been living these past nine years. May my pain bring you joy and wonderment, and may you enjoy the appendages you still possess, while you still possess them.
